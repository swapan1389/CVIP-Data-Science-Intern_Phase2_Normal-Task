Title: Diabetes Prediction

Description:

This repository contains the code,data,plots and dataset for a machine learning project that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not. The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of medical records for Pima Indian women. The dataset includes 8 features that are known to be associated with diabetes, such as age, BMI, and glucose level.

The project implements many machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction: LogisticRegression,KNeighborsClassifier,SVC,DecisionTreeClassifier,Random Forest and GradientBoostingClassifier.From those algorithms Random Forest algorithm is working fine better than other classification algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds a number of decision trees and then averages their predictions.

The project also includes a GUI interface that allows users to input their own data and get a prediction for whether they have diabetes or not. The web application is built using the tkinter and joblib.

Objectives:

The objectives of this project are to:

Review existing literature on diabetes diagnosis and prediction.
Design and develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes.
Analyze the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and use SVM and Random Forest algorithms to develop a prediction engine.
Build a web application that allows users to input their own data and get a prediction for whether they have diabetes or not.
